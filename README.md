## [Documentation](https://playwright.dev) | [API reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

## Scope

The scope of the project represents a template for playwright E2E Tests using TypeScript. All tests are performed on a mock website called [practicesoftwaretesting](https://practicesoftwaretesting.com) 
The template is set for multiple environments stage and dev, but you can add as many envs as you wish.


## Installation

Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.

### Using init command

The easiest way to get started with Playwright Test is to run the init command.

```Shell
# Run from your project's root directory
npm init playwright@latest
# Or create a new project
npm init playwright@latest new-project
```

This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts. You can now jump directly to writing assertions section.

### Manually

Add dependency and install browsers.

```Shell
npm i -D @playwright/test
# install supported browsers
npx playwright install
```

You can optionally install only selected browsers, see [install browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#install-browsers) for more details. Or you can install no browsers at all and use existing [browser channels](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).

## Dependencies
```Shell
# isntall package.json dependencies
npm install
```

## Run Tests

```Shell
npm run test:stage
npm run test:dev
```
## Generate Log Index html

```Shell
npm run post:test

```
